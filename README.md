# Taemoba

This implements a MVP for the Taemoba multiplayer game. It depends on https://github.com/VictorTaelin/uwuchat.

## Installing

Clone the uwuchat repo. Install dependencies with `npm i`. To recompile the project, run `tsc`. To start the server (in the default port `localhost:7171`), simply run: `node src/server.js`.

Now, clone this repository.

Install the dependencies with `npm i` as well.

To compile the project, run `npm run build`. You should have `webpack` and `webpack cli` installed.

Then, you can start an `http-server` in the repo (that will use `index.html` as entry point). Then you can simply connect to a room and have fun!
